This folder contains some snippets of assembly code for use
on the BeagleBone Black's programmable real-time units.
This sample code was developed as a proof of concept for a
project that ultimately I moved to a different platform; so,
while I wrote macros that moved words of data in and out of
main memory, I never wrote more than test code to use them.
That's why the slowflash.p program isn't very complex.
